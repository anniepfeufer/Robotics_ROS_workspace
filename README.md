## Running the Code

The ROS code has a launch file included, which means that to run it you can type " ros2 launch motor_ctl ___ " into the command line (assuming you have ROS sourced and built the package). 

The code also utilizes code from the Dynamixel Python repo in order to control the two servo motors in the robot.
